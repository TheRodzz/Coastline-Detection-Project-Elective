# Factorization-based segmentation Python implementation

This is a Python implementation of the factorization-based segmentation algorithm, which is described in 

**J. Yuan, D. L. Wang, and A. M. Cheriyadat. Factorization-based texture segmentation. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2015.**

The MATLAB implementation can be found at [here](https://github.com/yuanj07/FSEG). The results from two implementations are similar. The MATLAB version is faster because of the use of mex c code for computing local spectral histograms.  

## Prerequisites

Python 2.7
Numpy
Scipy
Scikit-image

## Usage

To try the code, run FctSeg.py.

Three test images are provided.
